# OPS-SAT Doom WAD Editor
On the fly edit the doom.wad file onboard the OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft.

## Getting Started
For the time being the executable just extracts SKY1's patch image data and writes it into the sky1.jpeg file. The [stb headers](https://github.com/nothings/stb) are are used for image manipulation and are included in the repo as a git submodule.


```bash
git submodule init
make
./wedit doom.wad
```

## Doom Palette
- The doom_palette.csv was obtained by extracting the PLAYPAL pallete from doom.wad via [SLADE](https://slade.mancubus.net/)'s export feature.
- The doom_palette.h header file was generated by executing `generate_doom_palette.py`.
